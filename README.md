# Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorithm Implementation

## Description
This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm, allowing users to securely share and reconstruct secrets using polynomial interpolation. By dividing a secret into multiple parts, the algorithm ensures that only a minimum number of parts are needed to recover the original secret.

## Features
- Decode y values encoded in various bases.
- Calculate the constant term (c) of a polynomial using provided roots.
- Support for multiple test cases from JSON input.
