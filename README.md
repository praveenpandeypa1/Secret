## Getting Started
Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/praveenpandeypa1/Secret-Sharing.git`, navigate to the directory: `cd Secret-Sharing`, and install dependencies: `npm install`.

## Usage
Run the program with: `node index.js`. Ensure a valid JSON input file is present.

## Input Format
Input JSON should be structured as follows: `{"n": 5, "k": 3, "roots": {"2": "111", "3": "1010", "5": "10011"}}`.

### Example Input File
Create `input.json` with: `{"n": 5, "k": 3, "roots": {"2": "111", "3": "1010", "5": "10011"}}`.

## Example Output
Expected output when running the program: `Secret (c) for test case: 4` and `Secret (c) for test case: 1`.
